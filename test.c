The Response::loadCgi function appears to be a part of a web server or HTTP response handling 
code that is designed to execute a CGI script (Common Gateway Interface) and 
capture its output to include it in the response to the client. CGI scripts are used to generate 
dynamic content that can be served over HTTP.

Here's a breakdown of what the function does:

int og_StdOut;: Stores the original file descriptor for standard output.

int pid;: Holds the process ID of the forked process.

const char* exc = "/usr/bin/php";: Specifies the path to the executable for the CGI script 
(in this case, a PHP interpreter).

std::FILE* temp = std::tmpfile();: Opens a temporary file to capture the output of the CGI script.

int fd_temp = fileno(temp);: Gets the file descriptor of the temporary file.

char* argv[] = {const_cast<char *>(exc), const_cast<char *>("-f"), const_cast<char *>(path.c_str()), nullptr};: 
Creates an argument array to be used in the execve function call. It specifies the executable and its arguments.

og_StdOut = dup(STDOUT_FILENO);: Duplicates the standard output file descriptor.

pid = fork();: Forks the current process to create a child process.

In the child process:
	Redirects the standard output to the temporary file (dup2(fd_temp, STDOUT_FILENO)).
	Executes the CGI script using execve.

In the parent process (the original process):
	Waits for the child process to finish executing (waitpid).
	Restores the original standard output file descriptor.
	Reads the content of the temporary file in chunks and appends it to _body.
	Sets the Content-Length header based on the length of the _body content.
	Closes and cleans up the temporary file.

Overall, this function is responsible for executing a CGI script, capturing its output, 
and incorporating that output into the response body of the HTTP response. 
It's a common approach to generate dynamic content in web applications.
