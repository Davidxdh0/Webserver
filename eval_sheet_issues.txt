Bij css laden, roept ie de css bij firefox 2 keer aan.
vaak refreshen soms error.

Mandatory Part
elke read/write call door kqueue
    -cgi

Check the code and ask questions
- Seems fine



Configuration
- HasAccess gives errors, which are ignored. Is it neccessary?
- client_max_body_size only available with m. NGINXdocs: Sizes can be specified in bytes, kilobytes (suffixes k and K) or megabytes (suffixes m and M), for example, “1024”, “8k”, “1m”.
- error_page working? Can't get it to work.

Basic checks
- Errorcodes not always right. Get a 404 when trying a forbidden method.
