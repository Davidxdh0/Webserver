Sure, I'll provide a brief explanation of each of the functions and 
concepts you've mentioned in the context of creating a web server in C++:

    htons / htonl:
        htons: Host to Network Short (16-bit) conversion.
        htonl: Host to Network Long (32-bit) conversion.
        Convert values from host byte order to network byte order to ensure proper 
		data exchange between different systems.

    ntohs / ntohl:
        ntohs: Network to Host Short conversion.
        ntohl: Network to Host Long conversion.
        Convert values from network byte order to host byte order after receiving data from the network.

    select / poll / epoll / kqueue:
        These are mechanisms for handling I/O multiplexing, allowing efficient management of multiple sockets.
        They enable your server to monitor multiple sockets for events like data availability, connection readiness, etc.

    socket:
        Create a communication endpoint, a socket, through which your server can send and receive data over a network.

    accept / listen:
        listen: Set the socket in a listening state to accept incoming connections.
        accept: Accept a connection from a client, creating a new socket specifically for that connection.

    send / recv:
        send: Transmit data from your server to a client over a socket.
        recv: Receive data from a client over a socket.

    bind / connect:
        bind: Associate a socket with a specific address and port, typically used for servers.
        connect: Establish a connection to a remote server using a specific address and port, 
		typically used for clients.

    getaddrinfo / freeaddrinfo:
        getaddrinfo: Get address information for a given hostname and service name, 
		useful for resolving network addresses in a protocol-independent manner.
        freeaddrinfo: Free memory allocated by getaddrinfo.

    setsockopt / getsockname / getprotobyname:
        setsockopt: Set options on a socket, such as configuring its behavior.
        getsockname: Retrieve the local address and port associated with a socket.
        getprotobyname: Retrieve protocol information by name.

    getsockopt:
        Similar to setsockopt, it allows you to retrieve socket options and their values.

    fcntl:
        Control file descriptors. It can be used to change the properties of a socket or file, 
		like making it non-blocking.

    close:
        Close a socket or a file descriptor when you're done using it.

    read / write:
        Low-level functions to read and write data from and to sockets or files.

    waitpid:
        Wait for a child process to change state, typically used in process management.

    kill / signal:
        Send a signal to a process, useful for process control and termination.

    access:
        Check if a file exists and if the process has permission to access it.

    stat:
        Get information about a file, such as its size, permissions, and timestamps.

    opendir / readdir / closedir:
        These functions allow you to work with directories, open them, read their contents, and close them.

These functions are essential building blocks for creating a web server in C++. 
They enable you to establish network connections, manage sockets, read and write data, 
and handle various aspects of file and process management
